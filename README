CMPE-283 Virtualization Technologies Assignment-2 
Team Members:
Gunjan Srivastava : gunjan.srivastava@sjsu.edu
Anupama Kurudi : anupama.kurudi@sjsu.edu


Forked the repo from “https://github.com/torvalds/linux ”
Install and configured VM Fusion to have Ubuntu OS running on it with nested virtualization enabled and increasing the memory to 200 GB
On Ubuntu, configure KVM
Download and install Virt-Manager. Using this install “LUBUNTU” to be the nested VM.
Build the kernel in Ubuntu with the following commands -
- sudo bash
- apt-get install build-essential kernel-package fakeroot libncurses5-dev libssl-dev ccache bison flex libelf-dev
- uname -a      
- cp /boot/config-5.4.0-52-generic    ./.config 
- make oldconfig      
- make && make modules && make install && make modules_install
- reboot

Check the kernel version to be updated to 5.10.0 - rc2
- uname -r

Made changes to the following files:
- arch/x86/kvm/cpuid.c : In the kvm_emulate_cpuid function-
/*Assignment2 CMPE283 code edit*/
	if (eax  ==  0x4fffffff){
	    printk("***********DEBUG_BEGIN***********\n");
	    ebx = ( (atomic64_read(&exits_time) >> 32) );
	    ecx = ( (atomic64_read(&exits_time) & 0x00000000FFFFFFFF ));
	    eax = atomic_read(&exits);
	    //	    printk("**** (Total number of exits: %ul EAX:= %u", exits, eax);
	    printk("**** EBX:= %u", ebx);
	    printk("**** ECX:= %u", ecx);
	    printk("**** Exit_Reason : ALL , ExitCount : %u\n",eax); //Debug Statement
	    printk("***********DEBUG_END***********\n");
	} else {
	    kvm_cpuid(vcpu, &eax, &ebx, &ecx, &edx, true);
	}
arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c: In the vmx_handle_exit function -
	 static int result = 0;
  	u64 start_t, end_t, total_t;
 
 	 // Every time the guest has exited, increment the number of exits
  	atomic_inc(&exits);
	
  	// Record the begin time of the exit
  	start_t = rdtsc();
 
  	// Call the actual exit handler
  	result = vmx_handle_exit_int(vcpu, exit_fastpath);
  
 	 // Record the time at the end of the exit
  	end_t = rdtsc();
  	total_t = (end_t - start_t);
 
  	add_exit_time(total_t);
  
  	return result;
 
Run the following commands after making the changes:
- make && make modules && make install && make modules_install
- reboot
 
 
Run the CPUID leaf function from the nested VM - Lubuntu
Run dmesg on Ubuntu to check the logs
Following are the results from dmesg:
 

 



Both Team Members installed and ran the above setup in their respective systems.
Gunjan Srivastava researched and implemented the code for calculating the timestamp on the 
processor cycle.
Anupama Kurudi researched and implemented the code for calculating the number of exits 
and storing it in the respective registers.
We worked together to merge our code and implement both functionalities on each of our local
environments.
